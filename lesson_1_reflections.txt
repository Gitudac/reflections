Using diff you can see all the differences between the 2 files which make it easy to find the bug in big files

It makes it easier to use older versions. Sometimes newer version might not work for some people so you can just use an older version

Manually: You might forget to create commits and you don't decide when to create a commit which might be bad because doing it
		  automatically might cause to create commits with no changes, too big changes or too small changes

You don't use Google docs for stuff like webpages(html,css,js) or generally stuff that requires mulit-file stuff

git log to find the id of the commits, git diff to see the difference between two commits

you can just return to older versions if you make a breaking change

I am currently learning android development at the moment so git might be useful in future projects
